	<h2>Autobiograhy</h2>
	<p>I am a first year student of Inha University. Regarding my academic plans, I want to become a computer software engineer. For that I need to get solid foundations in technical subjects. For example, courses like calculus, introduction to computer science, introduction to programming and problem solving can lay a good basis for further studies. Later on, I can continue with subjects as algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, object-oriented programming, artificial intelligence and more. The knowledge gained from all abovementioned subjects will for sure help me to become a good engineer, who can contribute to solve real world problems.Moreover,I tried to distract from studies by having some extracurricular activities. Football is my passion, as I liked both watching matches and playing in the pitch. On weekends, whenever opportunity arose, I tried to watch football matches of local ‘Aral’ football club, which plays in second division of Uzbekistan championship. Also, I play football with my friends on weekly basis in one of the futsal grounds in the city</p>
